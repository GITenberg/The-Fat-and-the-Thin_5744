description: "Le Ventre de Paris [lə vɑ̃tʁ də paʁi] (1873) is the third novel in Émile\
  \ Zola's twenty-volume series Les Rougon-Macquart. It is set in and around Les Halles,\
  \ the enormous, busy central market of 19th Century Paris. Les Halles, rebuilt in\
  \ cast iron and glass during the Second Empire was a landmark of modernity in the\
  \ city, the wholesale and retail center of a thriving food industry. Le Ventre de\
  \ Paris (translated into English under many variant titles but literally meaning\
  \ The Belly of Paris) is Zola's first novel entirely on the working class.\nThe\
  \ protagonist is Florent, an escaped political prisoner mistakenly arrested after\
  \ the French coup of 1851. He returns to his step-brother Quenu, a charcutier and\
  \ his wife Lisa Quenu (formerly Macquart), with whom he finds refuge. They get him\
  \ a job in the market as a fish inspector. After getting mixed up in an ineffectual\
  \ socialist plot against the Empire, Florent is arrested and deported again.\nAlthough\
  \ Zola had yet to hone his mastery of working-class speech and idioms displayed\
  \ to such good effect in L'Assommoir, the novel conveys a powerful atmosphere of\
  \ life in the great market halls and of working class suffering. There are a number\
  \ of vivid descriptive passages, the most famous of which, his description of the\
  \ olfactory sensations experienced upon entering a cheese shop, has become known\
  \ as the \"Cheese Symphony\" due to its ingenious orchestral metaphors. Throughout\
  \ the book, the painter Claude Lantier, a relative of the Macquarts and later the\
  \ protagonist of L'Œuvre (1886) - shows up to provide a semi-authorial commentary,\
  \ playing the role of chorus. It is an interesting and often powerful work, though\
  \ not usually considered as being on a par with the novelist's achievements later\
  \ in the Rougon-Macquart cycle.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
